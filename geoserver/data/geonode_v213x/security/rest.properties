# Default REST security configuration.
# 
# By default this configuration locks down every rest call. The following is an example of a more
# lax configuration in which read only (GET) access is allowed anonymously:
# 
#/**;GET=IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY
#/**;POST,DELETE,PUT=ADMIN
#
# The following is an example of a configuration that could be used with the restconfig plugin in 
# which only configuration in a specific workspace is restricted:
#
#/rest/workspaces/topp*;GET=ADMIN
#/rest/workspaces/topp/**;GET=ADMIN
#/**;POST,DELETE,PUT=ADMIN
#
/rest/process/batchdownload/download/**;GET=IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY
/rest/printing/**;GET,POST=IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY
/rest/monitor/**;GET=ROLE_ADMINISTRATOR
/rest/security/**;GET,POST,DELETE,PUT=ROLE_ADMINISTRATOR
# temporary hack until we put A&A on gsconfig also
/rest/imports/**;GET,POST,DELETE,PUT=ROLE_ADMINISTRATOR
/rest/br/**;GET,POST,DELETE,PUT=ROLE_ADMINISTRATOR
/geofence/rest/**;GET,POST,DELETE,PUT=ROLE_ADMINISTRATOR
/**;GET=IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY
/**;POST,DELETE,PUT=ROLE_AUTHENTICATED
